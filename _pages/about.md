Hi, I am Rafza!


I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Department of Automation Manufacturing and Mechatronics at Bandung Polytechnic for Manufacturing (Polman Bandung). With a passion for cutting-edge technologies, my interests revolve around Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Automation, and Robotics.

I obtained my tensorflow certificate developer at 2023 and currently working on an undergraduate thesis focused on developing a predictive analytical model for manufacturing scenarios.

In parallel with his academic pursuits, I am actively engaged in building side projects centered on embedded systems and mechatronics.
